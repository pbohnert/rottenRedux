--> Project User Stories

* User can view a list of movies from Rotten Tomatoes. Poster images must be loading asynchronously.
* User can view movie details by tapping on a cell
* User can pull to refresh the movie list.
* User sees loading state while waiting for movies API. You can use one of the 3rd party libraries at cocoacontrols.com.
--not done:
* User sees error message when there's a networking error. You may not use UIAlertView to display the error. See this screenshot for what the error message should look like: network error screenshot.
