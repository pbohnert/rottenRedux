==============

Codepath exercise to view movies from Rotten Tomatoes

-Finished first two required stories, though I don't have the scrolling on the detail view working the way I want.
-Started researching MRProgress from Cocoapods but didn't yet have time to implement story.
-Put in support for pull to refresh, but not sure I have it working.
-Didn't get to error message story.

Total time - 12 hours
